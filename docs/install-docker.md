# Installing MIMO Using Docker

## What is Docker?

Docker lets you package software into 'containers' for development, shipment and deployment. 

"A container image is a lightweight, stand-alone, executable package of a piece of software that includes everything needed to run it: code, runtime, system tools, system libraries, settings. Containers isolate software from its surroundings, for example differences between development and staging environments and help reduce conflicts between teams running different software on the same infrastructure."
