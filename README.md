The MIMO Community Edition is a feature rich guest WiFi system that you install on your own servers.

It includes everything you need to operate a guest network. This includes:

### The core modules include:

- API server for handling requests
- AngularJS dashboard for management of your splash pages etc
- Splash pages for guest access
